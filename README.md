h1 Tag:<br>
The "h1" tag is a heading element in HTML. It represents the top-level or main heading of a section or page. It is the most important heading and carries the highest significance. Typically, there should be only one "h1" tag per page, used to describe the main topic or purpose of the content. It helps in structuring the document and is used by search engines and screen readers to understand the content hierarchy.

p Tag:<br>
The "p" tag is a paragraph element in HTML. It is used to define and structure paragraphs of text on a web page. When you want to create a block of text, like a regular paragraph, you enclose the content within "p" opening and closing tags. The browser will automatically add some vertical space before and after the paragraph to visually separate it from other content.
